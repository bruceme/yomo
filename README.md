Autonomous solar-only lawn trimming rover

# WHY?!

I want a 100% autonimous non-stupid set-it-forget-it bulk grass cutting device that I didn't have to babysit, watch, push, tow or remote into.  Setup the parimeter and let it do its thing so long as the sun is shining and the good Lord is willing!

# Technology

- Old beat up Power Chair, preferably without batteries.
- Two Hedge Trimmers
- Raspbery Pi 3 A+ main board
- Adafruit GPS HAT
- H-Bridge to power the motors

# Design

This is the logical and physical layout of the components
